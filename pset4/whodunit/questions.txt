1. What's stdint.h? 
Provides a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros

2. What's the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
It signifies that you intend to use data in a specific way. 

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    BYTE = 1
    DWORD = 4
    LONG = 4
    WORD = 2

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    42 = B
    4d = M
   
5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfSize is the size of the entire bitmap file
    biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER headerfile. Always 14bytes

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
The bitmap is oriented top-down

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
fopen will return NULL if it cannot open the file.

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
The third arugment is always set to the number fread will read.  It is set to 1 because we will always read one file

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
1

11 What does fseek do?
It moves the file position indicator

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
Is an option used in fseek to set the offset realitive to the current pointer postion
